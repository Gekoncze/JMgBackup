### NOW ###
    add support for automatic copy of missing files (in selected paths) to context menu
        consider if confirm dialog is necessary before copy (in case of mis-click)
            it may display the number of files, their total size and a scrollable list of files to be copied

### SOON ###
    show warning banner or some icon or label when an action was cancelled
        explain that ui might be outdated
        remove the flag once directories are completely reloaded afterwards
        consider disabling some actions that may fail or behave unexpectedly
            consider allowing only full reload in such situation
        go through possible cases for each action and evaluate risks

### LATER ###
    add duplicate detector
        show different icon for duplicates ?
        allow user to configure duplicate detection to specify key properties ?
        duplicates are within same work tree
            but there could be also moved files that when copied would cause duplicates
        might need to also implement data comparison for precise detection between found suspects

    add context menu for tree entries
        add option to reload / refresh specific file or directory
        add option to show error details

    allow user to show usage in percent relative to parent total
        might want to add preference to view menu
        consider showing colors (for example red high percent, green small percent)
        could be added to details view too

    add more ui unit tests
        add tests for wrapper tree nodes (don't forget root path that has null file name)
        add test for directory tree (restore expanded, collapsed and selected nodes)

### CONSIDERATIONS ###
    consider merging simplifier and collector somehow

    consider showing disk usage somewhere near top (if possible)
        could then show warning when copy operation may fail because of not enough space in target device
        would need to detect device for path and read its properties somehow

    consider moving remaining logic from main window and directory view to directory manager
        such as reload and checksum actions in directory view
        actions over directories should be centralized if possible
        consider adding something like actions manager for ui layer
        consider if state should be stored in directory views or in some state object (wild idea)

    consider adding support for symbolic link copy
        could be nice to have a separate icon for it
        would need to add file type to file details view
        there is a problem of how to handle symlink paths:
            a) if outside of current work tree, what to do?
            b) if inside of current work tree, keep original symlink target or update it relative to target work tree?

    optimize directory search if needed
        currently iterating through all elements
        and also not utilizing sorted elements

    consider allowing multiple checksums types to be computed for a single file

    consider updatable progress description (or additional updatable field)
        possible use case: include processing speed updated in real time, such as kB/s

    consider allowing users to choose in main menu bar which kinds of errors they want to see and which to hide
        configurable via view menu:
            missing file or directory
            hash does not match
            possible duplicate of a file
            property not computed
            file system error

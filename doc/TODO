### SOON ###
    improve background task processing
        run sequential tasks in single dialog and thread
        consider extracting worker class from task
        consider introducing sub-tasks instead of sub-progresses

        show progress bar only after some time, lets say 1 or 2 seconds
            maybe only change cursor temporarily to loading one

    add icons to menu
    add support for drag and drop

### LATER ###
    add context menu for tree entries
        add option to show file or directory in file manager
        add option to show file or directory details
        add option to reload / refresh
        add option to show error details

    allow users to choose in main menu bar which kinds of errors they want to see and which to hide
        * missing file or directory
        * hash does not match
        * possible duplicate of a file
        * property not computed
        * file system error

    add duplicate detector
        show different icon for duplicates ?
        allow user to configure duplicate detection (specify key properties)

    add support for automatic copy of missing files
        files could have been moved, so consider utilizing some sort of duplicate detection for that

### CONSIDERATIONS ###
    consider adding support for symbolic links as files

    consider getting rid of directory service

    optimize directory search if needed
        currently iterating through all elements
        and also not utilizing sorted elements

    consider allowing multiple checksums types to be computed for single file

    consider showing special (warning ?) icon when checksum is not computed on one side

    consider updatable progress description (or additional updatable field)
        possible use case: include processing speed updated in real time, such as kB/s

    consider updating checksum if it is detected that modified date was changed
        would require very precise time
        would require to track timestamp for checksum

### SOON ###
    add unit test for progress updates and estimates
    add unit test for directory service
    add unit test for directory properties
    add unit test for total error count after compare
    add unit test for existing error clear
        for directories
        for files

    display better progress bar with an actual progress
        display number of processed items
            * as percentage if number of unprocessed items is available
            * as absolute number if number of unprocessed items is not available

        show multiple progress bars when there are sub-tasks

### LATER ###
    show question mark icon when matching file or directory does not have checksum computed
    improve details view - after clicking same element, it should still be refreshed
        this is when comparing details of two files in separate views

    add context menu for tree entries
        add option to show file or directory in file manager
        add option to show file or directory details
        add option to reload / refresh
        add option to show error details

    allow users to choose in main menu bar which kinds of errors they want to see and which to hide
        * missing file or directory
        * hash does not match
        * possible duplicate of a file
        * property not computed
        * file system error

    add more keyboard shortcuts to menu
    add icons to menu
    add support for drag and drop
    fix bug - after restoring tree node expansion, if all was closed then root is still expanded

    add duplicate detector
        show different icon for duplicates ?
        allow user to configure duplicate detection (specify key properties)

    improve sorting
        current sorting is wrong:
            Example 2
            Example

    add support for symbolic links
    add support for automatic copying files
        have it also use duplicate detection to skip possible duplicates

### CONSIDERATIONS ###
    consider updatable progress description (or additional updatable field)
        possible use case: include processing speed updated in real time, such as kB/s

    consider updating checksum if it is detected that modified date was changed
        would require very precise time
        would require to track timestamp for checksum

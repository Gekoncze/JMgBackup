    split compare task in 3 phases:
        1) load tree of directories and files (with properties)
        2) compute checksums
        3) compare trees

        for each display progress bar and short description
        the idea is to compare everything that is available
            and then user will choose in main menu bar which kinds of errors he wants to see and which to hide
                * missing file or directory
                * hash does not match
                * possible duplicate of a file
                * property not computed
                * file system error

        ensure that compare is called only if both directories are reloaded / up to date
            such as, comparing when we know that we will be reloading second directory is wasteful

        add support for loading of created and modified date

        consider optimizing reloading, specifically for hashes
            recomputing it is expensive, so it should be done only when necessary (soft vs hard reload)

    implement back hash reader

    add unit test for checksum service

    show task progress
        show multiple progress bars for each nesting level
        show regular progress bar when limit is > 0
        show indeterminate progress bar when limit is 0

    add context menu for tree entries
        add option to show file or directory in file manager
        add option to show file or directory details
        add option to reload / refresh
        add option to show error details

    add duplicate detector
        show different icon for duplicates ?
        allow user to configure duplicate detection (specify key properties)

    add support for drag and drop
    add support for 3 views
    keep opened folders (if still exist) after refresh
    consider adding support to compare last created and last modified date

### LATER ###
    improve display of last modified and created date

    improve sorting
        current sorting is wrong:
            Example 2
            Example

    add support for symbolic links
    add support for automatic copying files
        have it also use duplicate detection to skip possible duplicates

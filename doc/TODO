### SOON ###
    add unit test for progress updates and estimates
    add unit test for directory service
    add unit test for directory search
    add unit test for statistics counter
    add unit test for collect and restore checksum in checksum service

### LATER ###
    show total size in details

    add context menu for tree entries
        add option to show file or directory in file manager
        add option to show file or directory details
        add option to reload / refresh
        add option to show error details

    allow users to choose in main menu bar which kinds of errors they want to see and which to hide
        * missing file or directory
        * hash does not match
        * possible duplicate of a file
        * property not computed
        * file system error

    add icons to menu
    add support for drag and drop

    add duplicate detector
        show different icon for duplicates ?
        allow user to configure duplicate detection (specify key properties)

    add support for symbolic links
    add support for automatic copying files
        have it also use duplicate detection to skip possible duplicates

    show progress bar only after some time, lets say 1 or 2 seconds
        maybe only change cursor temporarily to loading one

### CONSIDERATIONS ###
    consider allowing multiple checksums types to be computed for single file

    consider showing special (warning ?) icon when checksum is not computed on one side

    consider updatable progress description (or additional updatable field)
        possible use case: include processing speed updated in real time, such as kB/s

    consider updating checksum if it is detected that modified date was changed
        would require very precise time
        would require to track timestamp for checksum

    split compare task in 3 phases:
        1) load tree of directories and files
        2) compute file properties (size, hash, etc.)
        3) compare trees
        for each display progress bar and short description
        ... the idea is to always compare what is available
            ... what properties will be computed will be set by user in main menu bar
                ... so not only file properties themselves will be nullable
                ... but also each property
            ... and then user will choose in main menu bar which kinds of errors he wants to see and which to hide
                * missing file or directory
                * hash does not match
                * possible duplicate of a file
                * property not computed


    show task progress
        show multiple progress bars for each nesting level
        show regular progress bar when limit is > 0
        show indeterminate progress bar when limit is 0

    add context menu for tree entries
        add option to show file or directory in file manager
        add option to show file or directory details
        add option to reload / refresh
        add option to show error details

    add duplicate detector
        show different icon for duplicates ?
        allow user to configure duplicate detection (specify key properties)

    add support for drag and drop

### LATER ###
    improve sorting
        current sorting is wrong:

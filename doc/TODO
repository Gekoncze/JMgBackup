    split compare task in 3 phases:
        1) load tree of directories and files
        2) compute file properties (size, hash, etc.)
        3) compare trees
        for each display progress bar and short description
        ... the idea is to always compare what is available
            ... what properties will be computed will be available in main menu bar
                ... so not only file properties themselves will be nullable
                ... but also each property

    show task progress
        show multiple progress bars for each nesting level
        show regular progress bar when limit is > 0
        show indeterminate progress bar when limit is 0

    add context menu for tree entries
        add option to show file or directory in file manager
        add option to show file or directory details
        add option to reload / refresh
        add option to show error details

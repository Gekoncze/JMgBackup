### LATER ###
    add context menu for tree entries
        add option to show file or directory details
        add option to reload / refresh
        add option to show error details

    allow users to choose in main menu bar which kinds of errors they want to see and which to hide
        might want to add to view menu
        * missing file or directory
        * hash does not match
        * possible duplicate of a file
        * property not computed
        * file system error

    allow user to show usage in percent relative to parent total
        might want to add preference to view menu
        consider showing colors (for example red high percent, green small percent)

    add duplicate detector
        show different icon for duplicates ?
        allow user to configure duplicate detection (specify key properties)

    add support for automatic copy of missing files
        files could have been moved, so consider utilizing some sort of duplicate detection for that

### CONSIDERATIONS ###
    consider showing disk usage somewhere near top (if possible)
    consider moving compare itself on directory to directory manager

    consider moving remaining logic from main window and directory view to directory manager
        such as reload and checksum actions in directory view
        actions over directories should be centralized if possible
        consider adding something like actions manager for ui layer
        consider if state should be stored in directory views or in some state object (wild idea)

    consider adding support for symbolic links as files

    consider getting rid of directory service

    optimize directory search if needed
        currently iterating through all elements
        and also not utilizing sorted elements

    consider allowing multiple checksums types to be computed for single file

    consider showing special (warning ?) icon when checksum is not computed on one side

    consider updatable progress description (or additional updatable field)
        possible use case: include processing speed updated in real time, such as kB/s

    consider updating checksum if it is detected that modified date was changed
        would require very precise time
        would require to track timestamp for checksum
